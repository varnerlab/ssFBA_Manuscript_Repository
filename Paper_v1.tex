Some journals require a graphical entry for the Table of Contents.
This should be laid out ``print ready'' so that the sizing of the
text is correct.

Inside the \texttt{tocentry} environment, the font used is Helvetica
8\,pt, as required by \emph{Journal of the American Chemical

The surrounding frame is 9\,cm by 3.5\,cm, which is the maximum
permitted for  \emph{Journal of the American Chemical Society}

Thus, unlike other synthetic biology modeling efforts, sequence specific constraints based modeling explicitly couples
the transcription and translation of circuit components with the availability of metabolic resources.
Model parameters were largely taken from literature; our approach had very few adjustable parameters thereby allowing the a first principles prediction of circuit performance.
We tested this approach by first simulating $\sigma_{70}$-induced deGFP expression and then expanded these studies to more complex multicomponent circuits.
First principles predictions of circuit performance were consistent with measurements for a variety of cases.
Further, global sensitivity analysis identified the key metabolic processes that controlled circuit performance.
Taken together, sequence specific constraints based modeling offers a novel means to \emph{a~priori} estimate the performance of cell free synthetic circuits.

\section{Introduction}
Cell free systems offer many advantages for the study, manipulation and modeling of metabolism compared to \textit{in vivo} processes.
Central amongst these advantages is direct access to metabolites and the microbial biosynthetic machinery without the interference of a cell wall.
This allows us to control as well as interrogate the chemical environment while the biosynthetic machinery is operating, potentially at a fine time resolution.
Second, cell-free systems also allow us to study biological processes without the complications associated with cell growth.
Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems are arguably the most prominent examples of cell-free systems used today \cite{Jewett:2008aa}.
However, CFPS is not new; CFPS in crude \textit{E. coli} extracts has been used since the 1960s to explore fundamentally important biological mechanisms \cite{MATTHAEI:1961aa,NIRENBERG:1961aa}.
Today, cell-free systems are used in a variety of applications ranging from therapeutic protein production \cite{Lu:2014aa} to synthetic biology \cite{Hodgman:2012aa}.
Interestingly, many of the challenges confronting in-vivo genome-scale kinetic modeling can potentially be overcome in a cell-free system.
For example, there is no complex transcriptional regulation to consider, transient metabolic measurements are easier to obtain, and we no longer have to consider cell growth.
Thus, cell-free operation holds several significant advantages for model development, identification and validation.
Theoretically, genome-scale cell-free kinetic models may be possible for industrially important organisms, such as \textit{E. coli} or \textit{B. subtilis}, if a simple, tractable framework for integrating allosteric regulation with enzyme kinetics can be formulated.

Stoichiometric reconstructions of microbial metabolism popularized by constraint based modeling techniques such as flux balance analysis (FBA) have become standard tools to interrogate biological networks \cite{2012_lewis_palsson_NatRevMicrobio}.
Since the first genome-scale stoichiometric model of \textit{E. coli}, developed by Edwards and Palsson \cite{2000_edwards_palsson_PNAS}, stoichiometric reconstructions of hundreds of organisms, including industrially important prokaryotes such as \textit{E. coli} \cite{Feist:2007aa} or \textit{B. subtilis} \cite{Oh:2007aa}, are now available \cite{2009_feist_palsson_NatRevMicrobio}.
Stoichiometric models rely on a pseudo-steady-state assumption to reduce unidentifiable genome-scale kinetic models to an underdetermined linear algebraic system, which can be solved efficiently even for large systems using linear programming.
Traditionally, stoichiometric models have also neglected explicit descriptions of metabolic regulation and control mechanisms, instead opting to describe the choice of pathways by prescribing an objective function on metabolism.
Interestingly, similar to early cybernetic models, the most common metabolic objective function has been the optimization of biomass formation \cite{2002_ibarra_edwards_palsson_Nat}, although other metabolic objectives have also been estimated \cite{2007_schuetz_sauer_MolSysBio}.
Recent advances in constraint-based modeling have overcome the early shortcomings of the platform, including capturing metabolic regulation and control \cite{2013_hyduke_lewis_palsson_MolBioSys}. Thus, modern constraint-based approaches are extremely useful for the discovery of metabolic engineering strategies and represent the state of the art in metabolic modeling \cite{2013_mccloskey_palsson_feist_MolSysBio, 2012_zomorrodi_maranas_MetaEng}.

In this study, we used sequence specific constraints based modeling to evaluate the performance of synthetic circuits in an \emph{E.~coli} TX-TL system.
A core \emph{E.~coli} cell free metabolic model, consisting of XX metabolites and YY reactions, was developed from literature [REF].
This model, which described glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, amino acid biosynthesis and degradation and energy metabolism, was then augmented with
sequence specific descriptions of genetic circuits which included mechanistic models of promoter function, transcription and translation.
Thus, sequence specific constraints based modeling explicitly couples
the transcription and translation of circuit components with the availability of metabolic resources.
Model parameters were largely taken from literature; our approach had very few adjustable parameters thereby allowing the a first principles prediction of circuit performance.
We tested this approach by first simulating $\sigma_{70}$-induced deGFP expression and then expanded these studies to more complex multicomponent circuits.
First principles predictions of circuit performance were consistent with measurements for a variety of cases.
Further, global sensitivity analysis identified the key metabolic processes that controlled circuit performance.
Taken together, sequence specific constraints based modeling offers a novel means to \emph{a~priori} estimate the performance of cell free synthetic circuits.

\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{Outline}

The document layout should follow the style of the journal concerned.
Where appropriate, sections and subsections should be added in the
normal way. If the class options are set correctly, warnings will be
given if these should not be present.

\subsection{References}

The class makes various changes to the way that references are
handled.  The class loads \textsf{natbib}, and also the
appropriate bibliography style.  References can be made using
the normal method; the citation should be placed before any
punctuation, as the class will move it if using a superscript
citation style
The use of \textsf{natbib} allows the use of the various citation
commands of that package: \citeauthor{Abernethy2003} have shown
something, in \citeyear{Cotton1999}, or as given by
Ref.~\citenum{Mena2000}.  Long lists of authors will be
automatically truncated in most article formats, but not in
supplementary information or reviews. If you
encounter problems with the citation macros, please check that
your copy of \textsf{natbib} is up to date. The demonstration
database file \texttt{achemso-demo.bib} shows how to complete
entries correctly. Notice that ``\latin{et al.}'' is auto-formatted
using the \texttt{\textbackslash latin} command.

Multiple citations to be combined into a list can be given as
a single citation.  This uses the \textsf{mcitelus} package
\cite{Johnson1972,*Arduengo1992,*Eisenstein2005,*Arduengo1994}.
Citations other than the first of the list should be indicated
with a star. If the \textsf{mcitelus} package is not installed,
the standard bibliography tools will still work but starred
references will be ignored. Individual references can be referred
to using \texttt{\textbackslash mciteSubRef}:
``ref.~\mciteSubRef{Eisenstein2005}''.

The class also handles notes to be added to the bibliography.  These
should be given in place in the document \bibnote{This is a note.
The text will be moved the the references section.  The title of the
section will change to ``Notes and References''.}.  As with
citations, the text should be placed before punctuation.  A note is
also generated if a citation has an optional note.  This assumes that
the whole work has already been cited: odd numbering will result if
this is not the case .

\subsection{Floats}

New float types are automatically set up by the class file.  The
means graphics are included as follows (Scheme~\ref{sch:example}).  As
illustrated, the float is ``here'' if possible.
\begin{scheme}
  Your scheme graphic would go here: \texttt{.eps} format\\
  for \LaTeX\, or \texttt{.pdf} (or \texttt{.png}) for pdf\LaTeX\\
  \textsc{ChemDraw} files are best saved as \texttt{.eps} files:\\
  these can be scaled without loss of quality, and can be\\
  converted to \texttt{.pdf} files easily using \texttt{eps2pdf}.\\
  %\includegraphics{graphic}
  \caption{An example scheme}
  \label{sch:example}
\end{scheme}

\begin{figure}
  As well as the standard float types \texttt{table}\\
  and \texttt{figure}, the class also recognises\\
  \texttt{scheme}, \texttt{chart} and \texttt{graph}.
  \caption{An example figure}
  \label{fgr:example}
\end{figure}

Charts, figures and schemes do not necessarily have to be labelled or
captioned.  However, tables should always have a title. It is
possible to include a number and label for a graphic without any
title, using an empty argument to the \texttt{\textbackslash caption}
macro.

The use of the different floating environments is not required, but
it is intended to make document preparation easier for authors. In
general, you should place your graphics where they make logical
sense; the production process will move them if needed.

\subsection{Math(s)}

The \textsf{achemso} class does not load any particular additional
support for mathematics.  If packages such as \textsf{amsmath} are
required, they should be loaded in the preamble.  However,
the basic \LaTeX\ math(s) input should work correctly without
this.  Some inline material \( y = mx + c \) or $ 1 + 1 = 2 $
followed by some display. \[ A = \pi r^2 \]

It is possible to label equations in the usual way (Eq.~\ref{eqn:example}).
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \, r^2 = 2r \label{eqn:example}
\end{equation}
This can also be used to have equations containing graphical
content. To align the equation number with the middle of the graphic,
rather than the bottom, a minipage may be used.
\begin{equation}
  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.80\linewidth}
    \centering
    As illustrated here, the width of \\
    the minipage needs to allow some  \\
    space for the number to fit in to.
    %\includegraphics{graphic}
  \end{minipage}
  \label{eqn:graphic}
\end{equation}

\section{Experimental}

The usual experimental details should appear here.  This could
include a table, which can be referenced as Table~\ref{tbl:example}.
Notice that the caption is positioned at the top of the table.
\begin{table}
  \caption{An example table}
  \label{tbl:example}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    Header one  & Header two  \\
    \hline
    Entry one   & Entry two   \\
    Entry three & Entry four  \\
    Entry five  & Entry five  \\
    Entry seven & Entry eight \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Adding notes to tables can be complicated.  Perhaps the easiest
method is to generate these using the basic
\texttt{\textbackslash textsuperscript} and
\texttt{\textbackslash emph} macros, as illustrated (Table~\ref{tbl:notes}).
\begin{table}
  \caption{A table with notes}
  \label{tbl:notes}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    Header one                            & Header two \\
    \hline
    Entry one\textsuperscript{\emph{a}}   & Entry two  \\
    Entry three\textsuperscript{\emph{b}} & Entry four \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}

  \textsuperscript{\emph{a}} Some text;
  \textsuperscript{\emph{b}} Some more text.
\end{table}

The example file also loads the optional \textsf{mhchem} package, so
that formulas are easy to input: \texttt{\textbackslash ce\{H2SO4\}}
gives \ce{H2SO4}.  See the use in the bibliography file (when using
titles in the references section).

The use of new commands should be limited to simple things which will
not interfere with the production process.  For example,
\texttt{\textbackslash mycommand} has been defined in this example,
to give italic, mono-spaced text: \mycommand{some text}.

\section{Extra information when writing JACS Communications}

When producing communications for \emph{J.~Am.\ Chem.\ Soc.}, the
class will automatically lay the text out in the style of the
journal. This gives a guide to the length of text that can be
accommodated in such a publication. There are some points to bear in
mind when preparing a JACS Communication in this way.  The layout
produced here is a \emph{model} for the published result, and the
outcome should be taken as a \emph{guide} to the final length. The
spacing and sizing of graphical content is an area where there is
some flexibility in the process.  You should not worry about the
space before and after graphics, which is set to give a guide to the
published size. This is very dependant on the final published layout.

You should be able to use the same source to produce a JACS
Communication and a normal article.  For example, this demonstration
file will work with both \texttt{type=article} and
\texttt{type=communication}. Sections and any abstract are
automatically ignored, although you will get warnings to this effect.
